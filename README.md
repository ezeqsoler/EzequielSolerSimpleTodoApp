## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered while building the app was using the Android Virtual Device to test the app. The AVD Manager ran very slowly on my laptop and it made it 
harder for me to run the app and ensure that it worked. Other than that everything else worked well I had some issues with the software but managed to fix them and ensure that the app works
